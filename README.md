# GO ACI
The GO ACI Module is a Go package that enables seamless communication with
Cisco ACI. It provides a simple and
intuitive interface to interact with the Cisco ACI REST API, allowing
developers to automate various tasks and manage the ACI fabric
programmatically.

# Features
* Connect to a Cisco ACI fabric using REST API.
* Run CRUD operations against the API
* Currently, we do not want to provide types for the ACI objects. However, this may change in the future.

# Usage
Coming soonâ„¢
